<!--
Note that the use of this template is NOT optional, I ask these questions for a reason. So any future reports that just delete the template and thus do not supply a proper explanation of the problem, will be deleted and ignored. 
-->

## The problem  
<!--Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing below. Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions. For questions, go to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/MUSfWXd) server, just remember to read the rules and keep in mind nobody there are paid, we're all just gaming enthusiasts and volunteers.-->

### Make sure you can check all these boxes  
<!--The game only finds new files on game startup, not on character relogs or interface reloads. So make sure you exit the game when updating addons to avoid this.-->
- [ ] I have the latest addon version available from CurseForge.
- [ ] I restarted the entire game after updating the addon, not just relogged or reloaded. (Only needed in Classic.)

### What game version(s) does it happen in?  
<!--The game uses different addon APIs in different versions, so this matters a lot.-->
- [ ] Classic 
- [ ] Classic (Public Test Realm) 
- [ ] Battle for Azeroth 
- [ ] Battle for Azeroth (Public Test Realm) 

### What addon theme(s) does it happen in?  
<!--The addon uses different code in different themes, so this matters a lot.-->
- [ ] Azerite 
- [ ] Legacy 
- [ ] I don't know what this means. 

### Does this happen with ONLY this addon enabled?  
<!--This is helpful because it tells us whether it's an addon bug or addon conflict.-->
- [ ] Yes 
- [ ] No 

### Does this happen with absolutely all addons (this included) disabled?  
<!--This tells us something about where the error is happening.-->
- [ ] Yes 
- [ ] No 

### What classes does it happen on?  
<!--This is helpful because the issue could be related to databases or class powers that differ in code from class to class. So even though it might not appear to be a class related issue, the bug itself could be just that. You don't have to actually tre on all classes, though, just list the ones you personally experienced the bug on!-->
- [ ] Death Knight 
- [ ] Demon Hunter 
- [ ] Druid 
- [ ] Hunter 
- [ ] Mage 
- [ ] Monk 
- [ ] Paladin 
- [ ] Priest 
- [ ] Rogue 
- [ ] Shaman 
- [ ] Warlock 
- [ ] Warrior 

### Any logs, screenshots, error output, etc?

### Steps to reproduce  
<!--If possible, tell us how to reproduce this issue. If you don't know exactly how to, please tell us what you were doing when it happened, in as much detail as possible. Include class, specialization, what quest/instance/battleground you were doing etc.-->

### Expected behaviour  
<!--Tell us what should happen.-->

### Actual behaviour  
<!--Tell us what happens instead.-->
